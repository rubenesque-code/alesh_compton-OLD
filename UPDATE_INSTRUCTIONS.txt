ADD PAGE
--------
CREATE FILE
- Create new pages in the 'pages' folder.
- You can copy and paste another page.
- Rename the file.
  - the file name will also be the route name (what appears in the browser's url bar).
  - it's not a good idea to use spaces; use '-' instead.
- The home page's file is always pages/index.astro

ADD DATA
- Add data for the page.
  - change the title and description.
  - add image.
    - you need to add any images to the /src/images folder.
    - make sure you get the import path correct.
      - follow the format already there.
    - the size of the image as it appears on the site is largely defined by the size of the original image.
      - this is true on large devices (devices in which the image display is larger in height than the image).
      (- on small devices images will all have the same height)
      - make sure your image is not too small.
        - the current images in images/butterfly/... are a good spread of sizes.
  - add youtube video.
    - simply add the url string copied from the browser url bar. The code will do the rest.
    - you can optionally add a cover image if you want.
      - you can also optonally add a position for the cover image.
    - IMPORTANT: if you add the same video twice on the same page it won't work.

ADD PAGE TO NAVIGATION
- Add the page to the /src/componets/PageLinks.astro file 
- if the route (which is the file name) is the same as the page title:
  - e.g. "Butterfly".
  - simply add a string ("Butterfly") to the 'links' array. 
- if the route (which is the file name) is the not the same as the page title:
  - e.g. Diary Part 1.
  - add an object (surrounded by {}) with a label and route.
  - you MUST do this if there are spaces in the title.
- the above is true for all pages but the home page which must only have a string.
- links in the array must be seperated by a comma.
- you can reorder the array however you want to reorder the links as they appear on the navigation panel.

ADD FONT
--------
- add font to public/fonts
- copy the format in styles/global.css

SEO
-------
- add a site description in /layouts/Layout.astro
  - inside of the meta tag in then content string. 
    - currently is "Joshua Gordon is a photographer and a director currently based in London, United Kingdom."
  - this appears in search engines.
